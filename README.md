# Williams et al. 2020 Orinoco optimisation and analysis
Code and data to run the optimisation and analysis from Williams et al. (2020) Minimising the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services in an intact landscape under risk of rapid agricultural development. Environmental Research Letters, 15, 014001. https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ab5ff7  

The optimisation.R file is the main code to run the optimisation. All files must be downloaded, and then are called into R by the optimisation.R code.
